# Rice_FinTech_Samplework
Sample work and skills from in class activities.
My name is Anna Wanzek. I attended the University of Notre Dame and earned a Bachelors in Civil Engineering. I then attended The University of Texas at Austin for my Masters of Structural Engineering. I enjoy problem solving, design, language, and mathematics. I currently live in Houston TX and work as an Engineer in Training designing custom residential homes. 
My career goals at this point in time involve continuing to build my engineering and design skills and hopefully to earn my PE license in the next few years. I also want to learn coding and data analysis skills. Both for my own knowledge and for potential changes in career or remote work I can do along with my current work.
FinTech is highly appealing to me as it is an emerging and growing industry. The combination of finance and technology compose many aspets of almost every company/industry today. For me FinTech appears to be an opporunity to apply my problems sovling, design, and analysis skills and use them with in FinTech field.
